🔧 1. Install and Run

Install Docker Desktop: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
Open the Docker Desktop app to make sure it’s running.
Check in terminal:

docker --version

📂 2. Create a Working Directory

On Terminal:
mkdir -p ~/mlflow-docker/mlruns
cd ~/mlflow-docker
touch Dockerfile

Then open and edit the Dockerfile:
open -a TextEdit Dockerfile

Paste this into it:
FROM python:3.9

RUN pip install mlflow

EXPOSE 5000

ENTRYPOINT ["mlflow", "server", "--host", "0.0.0.0", \
            "--port", "5000", \
            "--backend-store-uri", "sqlite:///mlflow.db", \
            "--default-artifact-root", "/mlruns"]

Save and Close.

Build docker image:
docker build -t custom-mlflow .

This will create a Docker image named custom-mlflow that runs the MLflow server.

Run MLFlow server
docker run -p 5050:5000 -v $(pwd)/mlruns:/mlruns custom-mlflow

Open Mlflow
Go to:

📍 http://localhost:5000

You're all set!!
